    <p>Sudha Murthy, chairperson of the Infosys Foundation, recently appeared on The Kapil Sharma Show along with actor Raveena Tandon and Oscar-winning film producer Guneet Monga. On the show, she revealed many interesting anecdotes about her life. One that caught everyone’s attention was that she and her husband, Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, didn’t go on a holiday for 30 years after starting the company.

        Narayana Murthy started Infosys in 1981, and since he was completely dedicated to his job, he relied on Sudha to run the house. She said, “When we started Infosys, for the next 30 years we didn’t go for a holiday because Narayana Murthy was always working. He used to tour for 220 days in a year. I never expected anything from him, I brought up the children and he had no clue about the house. When our kids went out, Narayana realised how much I supported him. Later he told me to continue with my career, and he is supporting me.”Sudha also credited her success to her late father, RH Kulkarni, who was a surgeon. She said that her father supported her dreams of pursuing engineering even though at that time, it wasn’t considered a profession for women. Sudha said, “Last month I went to Telco Pune, now it is called Tata Motors. I went there after almost 49-50 years. I went to the car division and I saw 300 girls working and assembling cars. Looking at that, I got emotional, and had tears in my eyes. It’s because my father. In those days when everybody was against the decision of letting me do engineering, he fought with them and let me chase my dreams. These awards, this respect I have received is all for him.”Sudha also credited her success to her late father, RH Kulkarni, who was a surgeon.

        She added, “I have handled 14 national disasters, I am never at home. I am always out, be it tsunami, drought, Covid. I am always on my toes for my work. Narayana Murthy always says, ‘It is her passion, let her excel. She gave me support when I was doing Infosys, now I will give her support when she is excelling’.” </p>

    <p>Sudha Murthy was born on 19th August 1950 to Vimala Kulkarni and Dr. R. H. Kulkarni in Shiggaon, a village in Karnataka. Her father was a surgeon and a professor at the local university, while her mother was a school teacher. 

        She was raised with her three siblings by her mother, father, and maternal grandparents, the latter significantly influencing her writing.
        
        The middle-class family was extremely education-oriented and supported Sudha in all of her academic endeavors. The result was a young woman pursuing the then male-dominant field of Engineering from B. V. B. College of Engineering and Technology. This college is now known as KLE Technological University. Later, she completed a Master’s course in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Science in 1974. 
        
        A dedicated, sincere, and committed student, she emerged as a topper in her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees. Consequently, the then chief minister of Karnataka recognized her efforts by awarding her a gold medal for the same. </p>
